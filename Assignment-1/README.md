Assignment 1 - One-Layer Neural Network on CIFAR-10 

Code:
* CifarDataset - load and process dataset
* NeuralNetworkLayer - architecture of neural network
* Optimizer - trains weight and biases in neural network
* Plot - plots results
* main - main code

How to run:
1. Change root_path in main.py to root path fro cifar-10-batches-py dataset.
2. Change lambda, batch size, epochs and learning rate in main.py when calling the train() method for Optimizer object.
